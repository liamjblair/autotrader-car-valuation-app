AutoTrader Car Valuation App

Overview: 

This is a simple project I created for fun to help me with selling my car. Web scrapping can be fun, so I wanted to do something useful with it too. This is a Python project for scraping car listings from AutoTrader UK based on user-defined criteria. It uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping and Selenium for interacting with the website.

Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages using pip >>
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
Run the script autotrader_scraper.py.

Follow the prompts to enter the desired search criteria such as make, model, mileage, year, etc.
The script will scrape AutoTrader UK for car listings based on the provided criteria and save the results to a CSV file named AutoTraderTest.csv.
Additionally, it will display some statistics about the scraped data, such as the highest, average, and lowest prices found.

Dependencies:
Beautiful Soup - For web scraping.
Selenium - For web automation.
Pandas - For data manipulation.

Configuration:
Make sure to have the Chrome WebDriver installed and configured.
